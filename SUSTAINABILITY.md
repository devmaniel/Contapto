## Revenue Streams

### 1. **Credit Sales** üí≥

#### Primary Revenue Source
Users purchase credits to access communication services, creating the platform's core revenue stream.

#### Revenue Model:
- **Markup on Credits**: Platform takes a percentage margin on credit purchases
- **Payment Processing**: Small fee on PHP and cryptocurrency transactions
- **Volume-Based Pricing**: Economies of scale as user base grows

#### Example Pricing:
```
‚Ç±100 PHP ‚Üí 95 Credits (5% platform fee)
‚Ç±500 PHP ‚Üí 480 Credits (4% platform fee - volume discount)
‚Ç±1000 PHP ‚Üí 970 Credits (3% platform fee - bulk discount)
```

#### Sustainability Factor:
- **Recurring Revenue**: Users continuously purchase credits for ongoing communication
- **Predictable Cash Flow**: Regular usage patterns create stable income
- **Low Customer Acquisition Cost**: Word-of-mouth and network effects

### 2. **Service Usage Fees** üì±

#### Per-Use Charges
Every message sent and minute called generates revenue through credit consumption.

#### Pricing Structure:
- **SMS/Message**: 1-2 credits per message

#### Cost Structure:
```
User Pays: 5 credits/minute

### 5. **Token Economics** ü™ô

```

**Platform Benefits:**
